This code sets up a two-player Pong game using the Turtle module in Python. Players control paddles with the 'W' and 'S' keys for the left player, and the up and down arrow keys for the right player. The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom borders, and rebounds off the paddles. Each time the ball passes the left or right border, the opposing player scores a point, and the game displays the scores at the top of the screen. The game continues indefinitely until manually stopped.
